# 1. INTRODUCTION OF WEB APPLICATION
**Project Name:** AI-Based Fitness Coach: Automatic Exercise Detection and Performance Analysis

University students increasingly struggle to maintain an active lifestyle due to academic demands, excessive screen time, lack of structured fitness guidance, and limited financial resources. Traditional fitness solutions such as personal trainers or manual workout apps are often inaccessible and unengaging. This project introduces an AI-Based Fitness Coach, a web-based application that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to perform real-time exercise detection and rep counting using a standard webcam. Built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and Python, the system supports exercises like bicep curls, squats, and shoulder presses. Additional features include a BMI calculator, workout scheduler, workout tutorials, progress records and an AI chatbot for personalized guidance. The application was developed using Agile methodology, incorporating iterative development and continuous feedback from university students through surveys. System design was guided by requirement analysis and includes architectural, use case, activity, and sequence diagrams. By automating exercise tracking and offering personalized support, this solution aims to promote healthier habits and enhance student engagement in fitness activities.

# 2. OBJECTIVES OF THE WEB APPLICATION

The developers aim to achieve the following objectives: 
- To design and implement an AI-powered exercise detection system that can recognize, track, and count different workout movements in real-time.
- To integrate computer vision and machine learning models for accurate movement detection and tracking. 
- To develop a real-time feedback mechanism that provides users with insights on their exercise form and performance. 
- To integrate a performance analysis feature that helps users monitor progress and stay motivated.
